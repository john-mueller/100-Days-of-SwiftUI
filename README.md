![Compatible with Swift 5.1][swift-version]
![Tested with Xcode 11.2 beta][xcode-version]
![Tested with iOS 13.1][ios-version]

Here are my solutions to the [100 Days of SwiftUI][100-days] course by Paul Hudson. I very much recommend trying to complete these yourself before looking at other solutions.

**10/12/2019**: There are some bugs with `Picker` in XCode 11.1 that affect my Day19Challenge project in particular. They are fixed in the current XCode 11.2 beta (11B41) using the iOS 13.2 simulator.
